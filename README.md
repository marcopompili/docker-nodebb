# docker-nodebb

Docker image for NodeBB.

## Description

This is a Docker image based on Debian (Jessie), Node 4.x and NodeBB 1.0.

## Installation

Use docker to pull the image from the hub:

```sh
docker pull emarcs/nodebb:node-4
```

## Container

To launch the container this is an example using docker compose:

```yml
version: '2'

services:
  nodebb:
    image: emarcs/nodebb:node-4
    ports:
      - 4567:4567
    volumes:
      - ./config.json:/nodebb/config.json
    links:
      - db_mongo:mongo_srv
  db_mongo:
    image: mongo
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data/db
```

A config.json file has to be mounted or the configuration
process of NodeBB will start.

A configuration example:

```json
{
    "url": "http://localhost:4567",
    "secret": "generated-by-configuration-process",
    "database": "mongo",
    "port": 4567,
    "mongo": {
        "host": "mongo_srv",
        "port": "27017",
        "database": "0"
    }
}
```

The secret is generated by the configuration process of NodeBB.

In this example MongoDB is used as storage, but also Redis is an
option with NodeBB.
